                <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> How did you get into law and juvenile justice?</td>
                <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> I had a job after college where I was living in New Mexico and I worked at a place called the Santa Fe Mountain Center … It uses wilderness experiences as a way of doing therapy, and self growth, and things like that. The organization was like that but we had contracts with the state department of juvenile justice to work with kids in the system. And so I did a lot of work with kids who were in confinement or on probation, and really enjoyed working with them, and in lots of ways could kind of identify with them. I grew up in very different circumstances, but hearing them tell their stories and seeing how they thought about the world, it made me kind of realize that, you know, there but for the grace of God go I. If I grew up in a different neighborhood with less support and structure, I could’ve ended up there too. …
        <br><br>Lots of kids screw up, and they make bad decisions, and it’s like the nature of childhood, and <span class='highlight'>they need second chances</span>, and third chances, and fourth chances, but if you grow up in certain communities, you don’t get those. You make one bad decision, and the bottom can fall out on you, whereas kids in other neighborhoods can make 20 bad decisions and they’re still okay. And so the idea of being a lawyer, and working with kids like that, hoping to provide second chances, appealed to me. So I went to law school with that in mind.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> I notice you’ve done a lot of different jobs connected to the system, and I was wondering how those compare to each other. Did you notice any significant differences between different types of jobs that you think are worth mentioning?
        </td>
                <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> Sure, I mean there’s lots of different ways to try to help. I started my career as a public defender, and I didn’t have any idea when I started my career where I would end up, I just started my career where I started my career. So I was a public defender, and after a year and a half or so got to work specifically with kids. And so that is much more about working with one child at a time, and kind of trying to do damage control. They’ve already gotten to where they are, and they’ve done whatever they’ve done, and you’re again, trying to create second chances and not have the whole system fall down on their head and ruin any chances of their future, in addition to making sure they have a fair trial and that kind of thing.
        <br><br>So that’s criminal work. To do civil legal work on behalf of those kids, that was appealing because then you get to look at some of the issues outside of their criminal justice involvement that probably have to do with how they got there. A lot of kids in the juvenile justice system have learning disabilities, and other kinds of disabilities. The schools have legal obligations to do things to help kids with learning disabilities, but a lot of times they don’t do that. So making the schools do what they were supposed to do … I mean, you’ve probably heard of zero tolerance, so often times kids get kicked out of school, and particularly back then, for stupid things, and they end up with no school, and they’re home all day, right? Who are you gonna hang out with when you’re not in school and you’re home all day, right? Adults who are not working, or kids who are home all day. And so I did school discipline work, I would try to make sure that mental health systems and other folks were doing what they were supposed to do for kids. So that was kind of appealing because that was more fixing the underlying problems.
        <br><br>And then I moved to Virginia and started this program to kind of do more of that, and over time, you began to see that there were all these systemic issues that were impacting all these individual system failings. So we gotta start working on the systemic level. We started doing policy work, started trying to keep bad laws from happening that would make life harder for kids, or helping get good laws passed that would make life easier and better for kids. And you know, obviously <span class='highlight'>kids don’t vote, kids don’t make political contributions, kids don’t go to Richmond to lobby ... and the parents of kids living in poverty don’t do those things either.</span> There’s nobody really there holding the system accountable and making sure that they don’t make dumb decisions. And so when I was at Just Children, we decided we should do that, because nobody was really doing that. And so we grew the organization and started figuring out how to do policy work. And then kind of a side project along with the development of Just Children was training law students to be good lawyers for kids. We started the Child Advocacy Clinic. Then I went over to the law school for I guess 4 years, supervised that full time just to take a break from having to raise money and all those things you do when you work at a nonprofit, and that was great. So I was going into court with law students, and either we were co-council or they were acting as the lawyers for kids. It’s a different way to impact the system, is to train more child advocates.
        <br><br>And then I got an opportunity to go run the department of juvenile justice, which I never would’ve imagined I would want to do, but I did. And that was really cool too. I had spent a lot of time in facilities, and had worked with probation officers, so I knew a fair amount from the kids’ perspective, but I didn’t obviously understand how the whole system worked, so that was great, and we got to do a lot of good work there too.

              <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> You mentioned you knew a lot from the kids’ perspective, and then kind of learned how the system works as a whole--what was the biggest difference you saw there?
      </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> Well one of the things that was kind of eye-opening for me was how important it is to take care of the adults who take care of the kids. Unless they have the training and the resources and the support and the tools to do the right work, even if they have good intentions, it’s going to be hard to do the work in the right way. It’s easy to say, “Well the kid’s entitled to this,” and “You need to do this,” etc., but unless you have a system that’s designed to do those things and deliver it, just shouting, or changing a policy, or being the smartest guy in the room--or the guy who thinks he’s the smartest guy in the room--that’s not enough … What we decided was really that <span class='highlight'>the adults really need the same thing that the kids do.</span> So we established what we called “guiding principles,” and the idea was that everybody, the adults and the kids, need to feel safe or you can’t do anything. They need to feel connected to people who care about them … You need to feel like what you’re being asked to do has a purpose that you agree with … And lastly, they need to feel, just like you and I, that they’re being treated fairly. So safety, connection, purpose, fairness. And we wanted the staff to feel like we cared as much about them as we cared about the kids.

      <tr>
              <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> Is there any case you’ve encountered that’s made a significant impact on you personally? </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> I don’t know that there’s necessarily one that sticks out. I mean I was lucky because I did both civil and criminal work, so I represented older kids, I represented younger kids, I represented kids who weren’t totally verbal, who had profound disabilities, I represented people who were over 18 who were looking at getting tried as adults. When I was a younger lawyer, and also a newer lawyer, when I was a public defender in Seattle, I represented a young woman who was charged with an armed robbery, and she was facing trial as an adult … and so my job in preparing for the hearing was to get all this information about her life, to say to the judge, like, “Look, this would be a terrible idea for this kid, and the chances of rehabilitation would be way better if you kept her in the juvenile system.” So I spent a lot of time with her, talked to all her family members, we got her evaluated, and she turned out to be this incredibly bright kid, who when her parents got divorced, it’d kinda gone off the deep end. She stopped going to school and started using drugs and drinking, and she was with this older adult when they committed this robbery … And as she was locked up waiting for this hearing, she realized that she liked to read poetry, and philosophy, and was really smart. and so I remember bringing her a volume of Emerson, she decided she really liked Ralph Waldo Emerson and thought he was really interesting. So to me, it was a great way to learn how complicated the lives of these kids are. And a lot of kids in the system have a story like that, or worse. … I heard after I moved from Seattle to Virginia that my supervisor in the juvenile division kept in touch with this young woman, and they were debating a legislative change that would have made cases like hers subject to automatic trial as an adult … and so she ended up debating on TV the legislator that was sponsoring that legislation. So it’s kind of coming full circle. It’s an example of the potential that kids have if you give them those second and third and fourth chances that they need to get through that hard part in their life.

It’s easy for politicians or other people to say, “He’s a murderer, he’s a rapist, he’s a robber, he’s a whatever,” like, kids are clearly capable of doing terrible things, but we need to, in most cases, not give up on them.

              <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> What sorts of duties come with your job?
      </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> My primary responsibilities right now are mostly intake. There’s two levels of intake within that position. One is on the civil side, and so those are kind of your custody, your visitation, your child support, things of that nature, just ensuring the petitions that I’m doing are within the code of Virginia and fit all of those criteria. The other side is going to be your delinquency intake, and/or your criminal petitions, if you will. And so, the way that that works is any juvenile that receives a charge in Spotsylvania County, or is alleged to have committed a charge, we receive a criminal complaint from the deputy. We first have to establish probable cause on that criminal complaint, and then once we do that, we kind of look at our options on what is the appropriate way to proceed with the complaint. So if it’s not a violent felony--there’s a statute that specifically defines what violent felonies are--and if it’s not a violent felony, and the juvenile does not have a strong criminal history, we can offer the juvenile a service to handle it outside of court, to put conditions in place and to handle the charge informally. If we are looking at the charge and it seems that the environment has a lot to play into that, we can refer the child and the family to outside community-based services that more <span class='highlight'>support and assist the family</span>. And then ultimately if we feel that it’s better that the court have eyes on the case for whatever reason, or if the juvenile has an ongoing criminal history, we can facilitate a petition, and then send that petition to court. We then have a system that we use to determine the juvenile’s risk level, if you will, and then from there we make recommendations based on our risk level and assessment … and then that’s when the judge ultimately makes their final decision on how they’re going to proceed with the juvenile in court.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
              <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> You mentioned intake assessments, and assessing risk. Do you do any of those yourself, or is there somebody else who does those?
      </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> No, so, if you talk to 3 different localities or districts within DJJ, each locality and/or district is going to kind of have their own process. So Spotsy is within the 15th district, which covers a bunch of localities within that district. I primarily work out of Spotsylvania, so Spotsylvania is one of the bigger districts and so we have localities, I guess. We have seven people in this office, so when I receive a criminal complaint, if I decide to handle it informally, it’s called a diversion. And so when I bring the juvenile and the family to handle it in this office and not have to send them to court, then I do the assessment. I’ll meet with the family, I will discuss with the juvenile the different questions that are on the assessment and things like that, and once I put in the information, it’ll tell me kind of what the juvenile risk factors are. And risk factors, you can equate it sort of to strengths and weaknesses, and so the risk factors are going to be the factors that are going to point them towards reoffending, the strengths that they have are going to buffer that risk for them reoffending, and so on.

      </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> Honestly, I kind of fell into this position. My background is with mental health, and I did mental health, foster care, therapeutic foster care, like intensive in-home services before accepting this position, so I always have kind of fallen towards juveniles. <span class='highlight'>I like working with at-risk youth and families</span> for whatever reason, as stressful as it is. But I do love it. I prefer the juveniles and I prefer the families, as opposed to adult mental health. And so I was living in Virginia Beach, and I was moving here, and this position was open, and I just kind of researched DJJ a little bit because I’ll be honest, I didn’t have a ton of information about DJJ because I was in the private sector … like I said, therapeutic foster care agencies, things like that. And when I started looking at DJJ and researching it, I would say that’s kind of when DJJ was starting a transformation, and instead of things being more punitive based, they were just starting to make that transition into more therapeutic based and supportive, and so I got really interested in it. I applied for a position here, and I accepted the position … it was a school-based probation officer at that time.

    <tr>
              <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> Since you’ve had experience working as a school-based probation officer, what are the differences between that kind of job, working directly with kids, versus what you’re doing now?
      </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> So, when I was a school-based probation officer, I had my own little office at the school and I had a caseload of kids that were on probation, versus now, I don’t really maintain a caseload so much. I have some kids that I work with, and I do kind of keep track of them, but I don’t monitor kids in the community. Now it’s more receiving criminal complaints from the Sheriff’s Office, ensuring probable cause, ensuring that the juvenile is not getting charges stacked against them and, you know, if we receive multiple charges, are all of the charges appropriate. So there’s completely different responsibilities there. When I was school based, I was strictly working with the juvenile and their families and monitoring their whereabouts, and ensuring compliance with their probation. I wasn’t really focusing on their charges so much as the probation side of it and ensuring they were receiving the supports they needed in the communities, and then monitoring their probation rules.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr class='odd-row'>
              <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> I’ve read a few articles about how probation officers are expected to fill a whole bunch of different roles for people, like sometimes therapist versus surrogate parent, all those kinds of roles. What would be your take on that?
      </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> I would say that is absolutely correct. We definitely wear a lot of hats. Your main goal as a probation officer is to support your juvenile … at the same time ensuring public safety, right? And so if you have a high-risk kid, you’re going to be meeting with that kid multiple times. And if a juvenile is high risk, a lot of times there are environmental factors that are kind of playing into that, right, like family and dynamics, things of that nature. And so yes, when you go to a house, a lot of times you are wearing multiple hats. You’re making sure that kid is going to school. You’re making sure that the kid and the family are safe. You’re making sure that they’re doing their services. You’re maintaining the case. You’re doing an ongoing assessment to ensure that the kid is receiving the appropriate services.
      <br><br>So you’re meeting with a kid, and you know, a crisis erupts in the family, and so you’re trying to peel through that crisis. So you’re a crisis counselor on top of it. You use your discretion to determine what services you can put in place in that moment to help the family, and then ongoing so you’re, you know, the therapist there trying to deescalate the situation and then assessing for services, and then you get into the court side of it …  you’re working with the Commonwealth attorney and you’re advocating for your juvenile. And sometimes you’re going to agree with the Commonwealth attorney, which is the prosecutor on the case … so you wear a little bit of an attorney hat as well. I guess maybe it’s more of a mediator hat in between the two attorneys, trying to figure out the best way to handle this case. And it’s definitely stressful at times, but it’s worth it. It’s to ensure that, you know, your kiddo is getting treated fairly, but also supported and also ensuring that they’re not going to run out and jeopardize public safety or themselves.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
              <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> So you say it’s more of a positive thing that one person has so many hats, rather than that they’re overwhelmed, that they should try to split it up into multiple jobs?
      </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> Yes, I mean, it’s a positive thing … The best thing that I can do is get that juvenile connected to the right type of service and person to handle that crisis, right? It’s like sex offenders. I can monitor sex offenders, but I can’t really do a ton of interventions and therapy to them, right? I can deescalate a crisis, but it needs to be a certified sex offender treatment provider to handle the treatment side of that, because that’s their specialty. And so yes, it’s overwhelming at times, and I think that part of being a good probation officer is being able to pinpoint the appropriate needs and resources in the community to connect your juvenile and family to.

      </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> I don’t know about juvenile justice in general, but specifically for probation officers, I think that, you know, you hear the words “I’m a probation officer,” and people automatically assume that you’re there to lock up their kid, or to lock them up, or whatever it is. And I think the one thing to clear up is that really it is to support, <span class='highlight'>it’s to provide support.</span> It’s to prevent things from happening. It’s not to be punitive, it’s not to lock kids up. I mean the last thing we want to do is to put kids in a detention home, right? So the goal is to maintain community and maintain the family as much as we can. And I think that’s where people get really surprised when they hear that, because they still have that old school way of thinking that probation officers are there to simply monitor and put you in front of the court and put you in jail.

              <td class='q'><span class='qanda'>Q:</span> Is there any specific case that you think has had a deep impact on you personally?
      </td>
              <td class='a'><span class='qanda'>A:</span> I don’t know about a specific case. I mean, you get to a point where after nine years of doing it, and after 20 years together as a whole in this type, it’s not specific cases so much that stand out. I mean there are, but it’s more the cases that you kind of pour your blood, sweat and tears into, those cases, and then they turn out to be the cases that keep you going, right? Like … it’s the kids that have the most complex trauma to me that always are the cases that stand out the most right when they get to us. 9 times out of 10, by the time they get to us, they are in serious crisis. And what I mean by that is they have committed pretty serious charges. They’ve had a lot of trauma in the past and they’re kind of just lost individuals, if you will, and so they’re all committing serious crimes. Or they get wrapped up into the wrong thing, and then you start to kind of peel back the layers on those cases and realize that this is not really who those kids are, right? And so those are the kids to me that I think you see the most transformation in if you put them into the right services, you get them connected with the right people. <span class='highlight'>You give them a little bit of direction and hope and guidance, and then they completely transform</span> into this good kid.
      <br><br>I had one that I think of the most is I had a juvenile with a pretty serious charge, it was a violent felony. At that time, I couldn’t put him back in the home environment, so they ended up going into a kind of group home, and it was an absolute disaster when they first went in the group home. But over time, I mean, this kid had a treatment team, I mean, I can’t even tell you how many people were on this treatment team. They had a really involved guardian, and they had a therapist that would come to the group home and work with them instead of making the kid go there. They had probation, they had the group home staff, I mean their treatment team was massive ... So anyways, at the end of that case, the work that was done by the treatment providers, and I won’t even put myself into it because mine was probation, right? I was a tiny little piece of that. I was just monitoring that the kid was doing what he was supposed to be doing, and that the families were doing what they were supposed to be doing. By the end of that case, the parents were on talking terms, they were allowing the kids to go back and forth into the home, they had put the supervision practices in place that they were supposed to. The juvenile had a job, he was on a roll. He was on the basketball team at school. … We were just looking at commitment, which is down in Richmond for him and not even willing to give him a chance in the community, and everybody kind of came together and was advocating for this kid. Because we’re like, “We know it. We know it’s in there.” And so I think those are the cases that stand out to me. Like you had a kid that was completely high risk, and we were seeing them multiple times a month, like had horrible peer groups just getting involved in all of this stuff and then to turn it over into where he’s at today … Those are the cases that stick out to me big time.
