      <p>Hi! My name is Autumn Ryan, and I'm a senior in the Commonwealth Governor's school (CGS). As part of the CGS program, each student is required to complete two 2-year research projects on any topic of their choosing. For my junior/senior project, I chose to research juvenile justice practices, which ones are most effective, and how they are carried out in the United States. I later applied this specifically to Virginia's Department of Juvenile Justice. I was impressed by descriptions of its recent transformation plan, but understood that things can look different on paper than they do in reality, whether that be a good or bad difference. I was curious to see what people directly involved in the system had to say about it.</p>
      <p>As I spoke to more people who work in juvenile justice, I began to rethink my approach. I've always turned to writing as a way to express myself and to process difficulties in my life, and it occurred to me that a lot of other people do the same. My research has taught me that often times people in the juvenile justice system have some of the most difficult things to work through. I realized that there are probably so many people who want to share their story, want to change the public narrative about them, but have never been given an opportunity to publish their work. I decided that instead of trying to decide for myself what the story was, I could give these individuals a platform to tell their story on their own. I could reach out to people in all stages and all sides of the system and all different perspectives; their own stories, however they choose to express them, could be put out into the world without the lens of anyone's bias, including mine.</p>
